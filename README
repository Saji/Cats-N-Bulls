Cats n bulls is a word game played between 2 people. The rules suggest that one of the persons (Say person A) is supposed to pick any 4 letter word in which the letters are not repeating and the other person (person B) is supposed to guess it in minimum number of attempts. The way this works is, B starts with a random 4 letter word. A then checks the letters contained in the word picked by him and the one given by B and responds with 2 numbers. Cats and Bulls. Cats is the number of letters that are common in both words and Bulls is the number of letters that are not only common but at exact same positions. For example, if "ACME" is the word picked by A, and "IDEA" is the word that B asks A, then B would response, 2 cats 0 bulls. Remember, that cats and bull are mutually exclusive. Whatever is a bull, is not a cat. For example, B suggests a word "ACHE", then A responds with "0 cats 3 bulls". This goes on, till A responds with "0 cats and 4 bulls".

This is a program to intelligently prompt word and arrive at the word chosen by the user.
